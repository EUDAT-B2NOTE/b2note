# B2NOTE

A [EUDAT](https://www.eudat.eu) service for creating, storing and managing annotations about online resources.

Annotations are comments and/or indications providing extra information about a resource such as a data-file.

The B2Note prototype service allows terms defined in controlled vocabularies, ontologies and thesauri to be used in annotations.

<b>[Click here for B2Note demo.](https://b2note.bsc.es/devel)</b>

The data model used in B2Note is based on the [W3C web annotation data model](http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/).

Please follow along guidelines outlined at:

[HOW TO GITHUB [...] by Rich Jones.](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/)

With the addition that the **name of the worked-on fork-branch** eventually submitted for a pull request should be formatted as follows:

> _contributor_short_id_ (optional) **_** _#issue_reference_number_ **_** _Code_change_description_ (omitting spaces)

In short:

1. Log an **issue** on source repository: [EUDAT-B2NOTE/b2note](https://github.com/EUDAT-B2NOTE/b2note/issues/new).
    1. Describe contribution objectives.
2. **Fork** branch of interest (or update fork if previously forked).
    1. Branch out from fork base using naming convention detailed above.
3. **Commit** changes to branched out code.
4. **Submit** reasonably documented pull request to branch of interest.
    1. May require preemptive alignment to target branch latest code.
